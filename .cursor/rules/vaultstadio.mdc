# VaultStadio – Rules Index

Project rules are split into several `.mdc` files for better context and classification.

## Rule Files

| Rule File | When Applied | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **vaultstadio-core.mdc** | Always | Language (English), project overview, structure, AI guidelines, coding standards, known issues |
| **vaultstadio-commands.mdc** | Always | Gradle, Make, scripts: build, run, test, quality, Docker, DB, Helm |
| **vaultstadio-quality.mdc** | Always | ktlint, detekt, FQN check, file size limits, testing, pre-commit order |
| **vaultstadio-backend.mdc** | `kotlin-backend/**` | Ktor routes, API conventions, Koin, architecture, limitations |
| **vaultstadio-frontend.mdc** | `frontend/**` | Compose MP, components, screens, ViewModel, expect/actual, known issues |
| **vaultstadio-api-reference.mdc** | API/shared files | Complete endpoint reference, shared models |
| **vaultstadio-plugins.mdc** | `plugins/**`, `plugins-api/**` | Plugin system, events, metadata/search, AI integration |
| **vaultstadio-docker-deploy.mdc** | `docker/**`, `helm/**` | Docker Compose, Helm, TrueNAS, CI |

## Quick Reference

### Code Quality (run before every commit)

```bash
make lint   # backend detekt; then cd frontend && ./gradlew detektMain
./scripts/check-no-fqn.sh
# Format: cd backend && ./gradlew ktlintFormat; cd frontend && ./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

### Key Constraints

- **Language**: English only (code, docs, comments)
- **Imports**: Explicit only, no wildcards (`import x.y.*`)
- **Types**: No FQN in signatures; use imports and short names
- **Max line length**: 120 characters

### Documentation

- **Index**: [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) – central navigation for all docs
- **Overview**: [docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) – what the project offers
- **Known issues**: [docs/architecture/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/architecture/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) – resolved and current technical debt
- **Roadmap**: [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) – phases and future work (Phase 7)
- **Commands**: See **vaultstadio-commands.mdc** for all build/run/test commands
- **API**: See **vaultstadio-api-reference.mdc** for endpoints
